          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>True Spirit is a new internet retailer for schools and parents that want a modern and fresh approach to school uniforms for K-12 children. It provides updated school uniform styles and provides a checklist for "must-haves" from the school's administrator for each new school year. True Spirit allows school administrators to provide a modern twist on school uniforms, by suggesting accessories that both fall within the school dress code and allow for students to be creative with their uniforms.

        <div id='role'>
          <h2>MY ROLE</h2>
          <p>For this particular class project, I worked individually to develop the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>User Flow for one of the three provided Personas, showing the selection and purchase process of one of the items on the True Spirit website.
            </li>
            <li>Wireframes for the above stated User Flow, showing all key screens.
            </li>
            <li>Clickable prototypes for key screens.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div><!--end of role-->

        <div id='challenge'>
          <h2>THE CHALLENGE</h2>
           <ul>
            <li>Creating an engaging and easy to use way for parents to purchase their children's school uniforms.
            </li>
            <li>Partnering with school administrators and convincing them to adopt True Spirit as their primary means of communicating school specific requirements and checklists to parents.</li>
            <li>Designing a solution that allows for parents to view school administrator curated selections, but does not alienate those wishing to browse and purchase from True Spirit anonymously, without creating a profile or shopping a specific school's uniforms. 
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Get to Know Your Users</h3>
          <p>Getting to really know who my users were was a primary focus for me in this project. We were provided three personas, but I really wanted to dig into their inner psyche and understand what made each user "tick." In order to achieve this level of empathy, I had to imagine each user’s scenarios and aspects of daily life that could present challenges. This information allowed me to craft an experience that was not only enjoyable, but also intuitively conscious of pain points such as time constraints and technological experience level.

          <h2>DESIGN</h2>
          <h3>Sitemaps and Navigation</h3>
          <p>In the initial stages of building the Information Architecture for the True Spirit site, I encountered an interesting quandary. Going into creating the site map, I believed I had all of my categories figured out. How difficult could it be, right? I was creating a Site Map for Uniforms, which consisted of normal things, like shirts, shorts, and backpacks. After performing a card sorting activity, I discovered how vastly different people's terminology varies. I also discovered, much to my chagrin, how much I still had to learn about my users. It took three iterations before I had my terminology and categories to a point that they were universally understood by users.

          <h2>Final Versions of Sitemap and Navigation</h2>
          <p>The final version of the True Spirit Sitemap was a blending of elements from both the first and second iterations sitemap iterations. The basic structure was retained throughout the iterations, however, after User Testing, the naming schema changed. The first iteration's naming schema was broken down into categories for types of shirts, shorts, pants, etc. The second iteration, which was adopted in the final sitemap, simply placed the items into three categories; tops, bottoms and accessories. This was a much simpler solution for users and kept the site from becoming overwhelming and information heavy.

          <h2>Wireframes and User Testing</h2>
          <p>With the Information Architecture of the True Spirit site ironed out, it was time to begin building lo-fidelity wireframes. My first wireframe concepts had an area to the left of the focal image to Login to True Spirit, Create an Account or Shop as Guest. Through User Testing and feedback, I quickly dismissed this concept, due to its "cluttered" nature. I opted for a much cleaner landing page, where key actions were easy to find, yet less distracting or overwhelming to users.

          <p>Clickable prototypes were produced, in AxureRP, after User Testing of Lo and Medium Fidelity Wireframes. Iteration on lo to medium-fidelity wireframes before development, decreases the time and cost of product development.</p>
