          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>The Space Bar Game is a 2D game created in Unity 5. This game is a basic block breaking game, modeled after the Arkanoid games, popular in the late 1980's. My main motivation in creating this game was to attempt creating a game in a language I had never programmed in, on a platform I had never utilized, creating something I had never attempted to create before (a video game). I wanted to take on the challenge of utilizing all of these skillsets. Furthermore, I wanted to complete this challenge, in a 5-day time frame.
          </p>

          <h2 class='crowdCareChallenge-h2'>CHALLENGES</h2>
          <div class='chal-mobile'>
             <p>One of the major challenges of this project was our time constraint. The timeline for this project from start to finish was five days. While five days may be enough time to produce an app in a discipline one is familiar with, it is a borderline insane endeavor for one that knows nothing about the language or gaming platforms, to speak of.
            </p>

             <p>The learning curve was an obvious challenge, but more so due to having no prior knowledge of gaming engines. While I hadn't programmed in C#, prior to this project, I found it to be less of a challenge than navigating Unity, itself.
            </p>

            <p>My greatest challenge, should become a learning lesson for all Unity beginners. Thou shalt not watch tutorials from deprecated versions of Unity and expect new releases to perform the same. This was a HUGE learning lesson for me, as Unity 5 changed drastically from Unity 4 (both in layout and in scripting syntax structure). I cannot begin to tell you how many hours were spent beating my head against the wall with this one.</p>
