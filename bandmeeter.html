          <h3 class='bm-discovery-h3-1'>Competitive Analysis</h3>
          <p class='bm-discovery-p1'>We conducted a Competitive Analysis in order to find out what the digital landscape looked like for local musicians looking to share music, network, collaborate &amp book gigs.

          <h3 class='bm-discovery-h3-2'>What We Learned</h3>
          <p class='bm-discovery-p2'>We learned that most of the current sites for musicians looking to collaborate, book gigs, network or share music charged an expensive monthly fee. The sites we researched were not focused on fostering the local music scene. </p>
          <p class='bm-discovery-p2'>The current competitor sites weren't satisfying local musician's needs and were generally focused on one main task, such as selling music or booking gigs. There was a real need for a digital platform that could place emphasis on the multiple needs of local musicians.</p>

          <h2>PERSONA DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <p>After going out into the field and conducting interviews and surveys, we put our noses to the grindstone and began to develop three very unique User Personas that could utilize Bandmeeter. These Personas were based around data collected from Contextual Analysis in the field, User Surveys, Interviews with Peer Musicians, various local music venues, coffee shops, record shops and instrument shops. All of our user research was solely focused on the local music community, in Austin, Texas.

          <h2>EMPATHY MAPPING</h2>
          <p>One of our first stops on our journey to developing Bandmeeter's User Personas was empathy mapping. This exercise helped us to consider what each user was thinking, feeling, doing, seeing and hearing on a day to day basis (as it relates to their musical desires). Empathy mapping allowed us to discover possible pain-points and challenges that could emerge as they engaged with Bandmeeter.</p>

          <h2>NARROWING SCOPE &amp STRUCTURE</h2>
          <h3 class='scope-h3'>Card Sorting &amp Defining the MVP</h3>
          <p>We performed a Card Sorting Activity in order to narrow down our scope and define our Minimum Viable Product.  The sort allowed us to define what elements and features were the most important to our users. We structured our MVP into an Agile Workflow, in the interest of time. Our first sprint was comprised of features we must have in order to be useful to our users. The second sprint included features our users would like to have, but were not necessarily a must have at this point in time. Our third, and final sprint, included features to be implemented in the future. These were the "bells and whistles" for our users.

          <h2>Wireframes</h2>
          <p class='bm-wires-p1'>We began to drill down on the details for our interface, via sketching and iterating those sketches around user feedback. The sketch below shows a possible interface for a band utilizing Bandmeeter to find a new band member. Originally, we thought about adding a feature that would allow users to add onto each other’s recorded tracks. Due to our two-week time constraint, we decided this would be a future feature that could be implemented into the interface.</p>

          <p class='bm-wires-p3'>I created a hi-fidelity mock-up to help Guitar Center better visualize how their branding could be incorporated into the Bandmeeter Application. This interface
