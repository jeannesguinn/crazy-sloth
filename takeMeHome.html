          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p class='bm-overview ts-overview'>The Take Me Home App was created in an effort to connect animals in rescues and shelters with potential new forever homes. After researching the applications that are currently available, a recurring theme became painfully clear. There are no pet adoption apps on the market that provide a clean, seamless interface. We created the Take Me Home App in hopes that we can help all homeless pets find life long love connections with their humans.

          <h2 class='crowdCareChallenge-h2'>CHALLENGES</h2>
          <div class='chal-mobile'>
             <p>As a team, one of our challenges, out of the gate was with our the first API we attempted to utilize. Lack of documentation and explanation of requirements created a major hurdle, when we attempted to utilize the API. Luckily, we found the petfinder API, which has much better documentation. While the petfinder API proved to be a better solution for our app, we did encounter a challenge with the image data. Given that the petfinder API collects data from a database of over 300,000 pets and 11,000 animal welfare organizations, there was no set standard for image quality. We encountered documents containing images of varying resolution and size, which made our goal of providing a clean visual experience, a bit of a challenge. When all was said and done, we found that certain image positions in the array of objects returned, were of higher quality than others, but there was no real consistency to speak of.</p>

             <p>Another major hurdle was learning how to navigate the team's code. Throughout the development cycle of our app, it became very apparent how important readable code is. This proved to be a valuable learning experience, early on. Luckily, our team wrote relatively clean code, minimizing our potential issues.

          <div class='moscow-tble'>
            <h3>MOSCOW</h3>
            <p>We approached creating this app with the MVP in mind. We utilized a MOSCOW strategy for development.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><span>Mo - Must Have:</span> What does this app absolutely HAVE TO HAVE in order to function properly? This is also known as the MVP.</li>
              <li><span>S -  Should Have:</span> This functionality is what the app should have, based on what a user expects to see in a pet adoption app. This is based on the products that have already paved the way in the market space. Users have seen certain features on similar apps, so this is their "norm".
              </li>
              <li><span>Co - Could Have:</span> These are the "bells and whistles" features that could be added to increase the WOW factor of our app. These will only be implemented after the Must Haves and Should Haves are fleshed out, and solidly working.
              </li>
              <li><span>W -  Won't Have:</span>W -  Won't Have: Generally, these are the ideas akin to "Let's create an app that's a mash up of Facebook and... all of Google... and let's do it in a couple of days!" In other words, these are features that are placed in the Ice Box.</li>

          <p class='api-p2'>The Petfinder API gives developers access to access Petfinder's database of over 300,000 adoptable pets and 11,000 animal welfare organizations (AWO). In addition to searching for adoptable pets on the Petfinder.com web site, you can use the API to create your own dynamic pet web sites or applications, using the same data we use on Petfinder.com.

          <h2>Future Development Plans</h2>
          <p class='tmh-future-p1'>Where do we go from here, you might ask? Well, for starters... we'd like to include a way for users to donate to animals that they would like to help, but can't adopt. The donate feature would allow users to contribute a certain amount that would be sent to the "hosting" shelter or rescue group. This contribution will pay for the animal's needs, while they're in their temporary home, such as food, medical needs or even toys (Hey, it's about the creature comforts too!).
          </p>
          <p class='tmh-future-p2'>We'd also like to implement a volunteer feature, where users are able to sign up and help out at shelters and rescue groups in need of some extra hands. This feature would include a calendar, where Administrators of Rescues and Shelters could post times/days they need help and volunteers could click and sign up for a shift on the designated days/times. Marketing, Marketing, Marketing! We'd like to provide an even better experience for our users, so that we can facilitate animals finding loving homes! NO PET LEFT BEHIND!</p>
